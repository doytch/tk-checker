Write now. Research Later. The TK Checker plugin is a productivity tool for writers that summarises the places in your posts that you have marked to re-visit. This separates writing from research and makes adding in missing information easier.

Authors & journalists regularly use a temporary marker like TK in their writing where information is missing. For example :-

"The Eiffel Tower is TK metres tall" or "His shirt was a vibrant TK colour" or "Visit our website at TK"

This marks the spot where a fact needs to be researched, descriptive words need to be considered or links, addresses and phone numbers need to be verified.

They are all points in a document that will need to be revisited before publishing. This method helps writers to stay in the zone & get the general core concept of their piece written without getting lost in research or fact checking. It helps writers to move through blocks and save the final details to the end.

Once you have finished your article, you then have to revisit each marker in the document and replace it with the missing information. When this is done by hand it's often easy to miss the occasional item, authors become blind to their chosen marker and articles often get published with TK's still in place.

This is where TK Checker comes in.

When logged into your WordPress site, underneath each 'Edit Post' window TK Checker will summarise all of the locations within your document where information is missing and provide you with a list of what you need to go and research. No more manual find & replace.

TK Checker allows you to set your own marker e.g TK, QQ or anything you like.

The plugin also allows for 2 way editing. You can edit in summary box & your main post will update. You can edit your post & the summary box will update.

TK Checker will tell you when all of your research is complete.

It will even warn you if you try to publish with markers still in the post!

## Frequently Asked Questions ##

### Do I have to use TK as my marker? ###

No, not at all. TK is mainly used because it appears infrequently throughout in the English language. With the TK Checker plugin you can use any string of characters. Touchtypers tend to use QQ. Other common markers include // <> and ** - whatever you choose make sure it is reasonably unique and won't naturally appear in the body of your text.

### So then, how often does TK appear in the English language? ###

Not often. If you are writing about any of the following things it would be best to use another wildcard character.
Atkins, Atkinson, catkin, catkins, giantkiller, Kamchatka, Kropotkin, latke, latkes, outkeep, outkeeping, outkeeps, outkept, outkick, outkicked, outkicking, outkicks, outkill, outkilled, outkilling, outkills, outkiss, outkissed, outkisses, outkissing, pocketknife, pocketknives, Watkins, wicketkeeper, wicketkeepers, wicketkeeping

### Is TK Checker case sensitive? ###

Yes it is! Example :- If you set your wildcard to be tk it will NOT find instances of TK and vice versa.

### Does my wildcard need spaces before & after it? ###

No, it will find your wildcard both with and without spaces.

### Can I use 2 different wildcards? ###

You can change your wildcard marker at any time but you cannot search on 2 strings at once.
It only finds what the wildcard setting is currently set to.
If you have 2 draft post and one uses TK and one uses QQ you will need to change the wildcard in the settings to match the post you are working on. Ideally stick to one wildcard marker and use that for all posts.

### Does TK Checker work on Pages? ###

TK Checker works on Posts currently. Although you can copy any kind of info into a draft Post and have it check for missing info.
Then it can be copied over to a page or other document ready for publishing.
